# promote-skill.sh: promotion gate v2 (Qodo PR-review flow).
# The original gate used the Qodo CLI, which Qodo discontinued (backend refuses all calls
# as of 2026-07-05). The working Qodo product is automatic PR review on a connected Git
# provider, so promotion is now a PR: skill files enter .claude/skills/ on a branch, Qodo
# reviews the diff at app.qodo.ai (repo must be connected once), merge = promoted.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/promote-skill.sh <inbox-skill-name> [<inbox-skill-name>...]
# Creates branch promote/<first-name>[-etc], copies each skill's SKILL.md dir from
# .claude/skills-inbox/ into .claude/skills/, commits, pushes, opens a PR.
# After Qodo review passes: merge the PR, update docs/skill-adoption-ledger.md, and
# copy the promoted files back into the working tree via git pull.
